   Setup (For Non-Coders)

    Step 1: Install Python

1. Go to https://python.org/downloads
2. Download and run the installer
3. **IMPORTANT: Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH"**
4. Click Install

    Step 2: Open Command Prompt

**Windows:**
- Press the Windows key
- Type `cmd`
- Hit Enter

**Mac:**
- Press Cmd + Space
- Type `terminal`
- Hit Enter

    Step 3: Install Required Packages

Copy and paste this line into the command prompt and hit Enter:

```
pip install yfinance pandas numpy scipy
```

Wait for it to finish (takes about a minute).

    Step 4: Download the Script

Save the `dealer_liquidity_monitor.py` file to your Downloads folder.

    Step 5: Run It

In the command prompt, type these two lines (hit Enter after each):

```
cd Downloads
python dealer_liquidity_monitor.py
```

    Step 6: Use It

You'll see a menu:
- Type `1` to analyze a single stock
- Type `3` for a quick scan of SPY, QQQ, IWM, AAPL, TSLA
- Type `4` to exit

When prompted, enter a stock symbol like `SPY` or `AAPL`.

 

   What The Output Means

    Liquidity Stress Score (0-100)
- **0-50**: Balanced — dealers aren't particularly worried
- **50-65**: Moderate — slight tilt toward downside fear
- **65-100**: Elevated — dealers are charging more for downside protection

    Delta-Matched Spread Asymmetry
Compares put spreads vs call spreads at the same risk level:
- **ATM**: At-the-money options (delta ~0.50)
- **25d**: 25-delta options (typical hedge level)
- **10d**: 10-delta options (tail/crash protection)

Positive asymmetry = puts have wider spreads = downside fear.

    Term Structure
Shows how the asymmetry changes across expiration dates. Wider spreads at specific expiries usually means an event (earnings, Fed meeting).

    Likely Pin Strikes
Where price might "stick" on expiration Friday, based on open interest concentration.

    Tail Stress
Compares deep OTM puts (10-delta) to regular OTM puts (25-delta). If 10d puts have much wider spreads, dealers are really scared of a crash.

 

   Limitations

1. **Yahoo data is delayed** — not real-time, sometimes stale
2. **Wide spreads can mean illiquidity** — not always fear
3. **No actual dealer data** — we're inferring, not seeing their books
4. **Works best on liquid names** — SPY, QQQ, AAPL are reliable; small caps are noisy
5. **Snapshot, not predictive** — tells you what's happening now

 

   One-Liner Explanation

Compares put vs call bid-ask spreads at matched deltas, adjusted for liquidity, to measure downside stress using live Yahoo Finance data.

 

   Troubleshooting

**"python is not recognized"**
- Reinstall Python and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"

**"No module named yfinance"**
- Run `pip install yfinance pandas numpy scipy` again

**"No options available"**
- That stock doesn't have options, try SPY or AAPL

**Colors look weird**
- Windows command prompt sometimes doesn't show colors right. The data is still correct.
